                                                Risk Analysis 
                                    Team 8 - Mobile App for Party playlist

Risks:

Team members are not familiar with the android programming techniques involved. 
Working of REST API is something new to the team members.
Project Interface has not been defined yet, so confusion might arise as to how best to define the layout.
Integration with mobile backend services might be an issue, considering the fact that the project is in its initial stages.
Since there is some amount of dependency on other teams, the specifications needed to develop the app might be delayed.
The requirements of the project are subject to changes, especially if we take the optional functionality into consideration. 
Inability to meet project deadlines due to unforeseen circumstances.
Since the app is being developed by a team of four, only limited amount of testing is    feasible.
With increase in complexity of the system along with time, the code becomes harder to maintain.
 Architectural adaptation may be required during the development process.
 
Possible mitigation strategies:

Tutorials and development of a few simple apps would help with familiarization of the android platform.
Building some working prototypes initially to learn about how REST API works and then gradually modifying the prototype according to the project requirements will be helpful. 
Constant interaction with other teams building other modules will help in getting a better idea of the expectations with respect to the app layout. 
To handle changing requirements and delayed specifications might be challenging to mitigate. Incremental rounds of developing the app might be helpful in this case.
Testing of the app by a group of external users will help in detecting errors not found due to “developer bias.”  

Possible prototypes to address potential issues:

Using online resources to learn about REST API and building of working prototypes for sharing information among multiple users, subject to changing project requirements.
Development of an intermediate prototype with a layout for basic functionality can be done (For example: Creating a single playlist, searching for songs and adding songs to it). This can be changed through future iterations to get the final working prototype after definition of the final project layout and consultation with other teams.
Development of a prototype that is able to share playlist among multiple devices. This prototype can be incorporated with other modules to build the final app.
